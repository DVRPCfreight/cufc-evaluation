Under the FAST Act Metropolitan Planning Organizations and State Departments of Transportation are tasked with designating Critical Urban and Rural Freight Corridors. Corridors eligible for inclusion provide key connections between the National Highway Freight Network, intermodal facilities, and important freight activity centers. </p><p>Based on freight activity, connectivity, and network continuity considerations, DVRPC has identified five potential corridors in the Pennsylvania counties of the region. <b>We are asking our stakeholders to provide feedback on these corridors.</b></p><p><b>How to use this tool</b><br/><p>This tool allows for you the user to vote and comment on each recommended corridor. The orange facilities on the map represent the Critical Urban Freight Corridors. To provide feedback click on the facility in the map or select the name from the list in the sidebar to the right. By clicking the heart symbol, you can register a vote in support. To oppose or provide additional comment on your support, select the comment image.<br/></p><p>For additional feedback and other comments please contact Michael Ruane at <a href='mailto:mruane@dvrpc.org'>mruane@dvrpc.org</a>.</p>",
